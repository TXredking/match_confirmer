# Love Match Confirmer

This application probably won't tell you anything you haven't already suspected about your current relationship but feel free to use this as a shameless starting point to "We need to talk..." wherever you may want that conversation to lead.

``` Love Match Confirmer is not responsible for any major romantic upheavals in yours or anyone else's life. We are merely commenting on the information y'all give us, much like your judgmental potential future mother-in-law.```
