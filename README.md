# Love Match Confirmer

This application probably won't tell you anything you aren't already suspect about your significant other but feel free to use this as starting point to "start the conversation" wherever you want that conversation to lead.

``` Love Match Confirmer is not responsible for any major romantic upheavals in yours or anyone else's life. We are merely commentating on the information y'all are giving us, much like your judgmental potential future mother in law.```
